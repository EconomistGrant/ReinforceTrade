# ReinforceTrade
Author: Songhao LI, MIT Master of Finance\
Date: 2020/12/29\
A new project based on tensortrade

Why start this new project: 
1) practice RL / programming techniques
2) have your own modularized, modifiable RL project
3) learn to use some good frameworks (mostlikely TF) through the process
4) explore some common features / caveats of machine learning that might be important in later study / work / intervierws


Objectives:
1) Modular. Easy to implement / modify / upgrade 
2) Universal. Fits as many algorithms / data set formats as possible
3) Efficient. Explore techniques like GPU / multicore/ multithreads calculation

Talk is Cheap. Show me the code

Supports TF2.0+, not so easy to start

Stable baselines
- does not support TF2.0+
